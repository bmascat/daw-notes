Salsa is danced in an eight-count pattern.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We start with the basic step: forward with the left foot, 
back to center, backward with the right foot, and back to center.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's important to maintain an upright but relaxed posture, 
with arms in frame position for partner dancing.
