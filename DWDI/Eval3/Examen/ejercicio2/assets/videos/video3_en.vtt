00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.679
[Applause]

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.150
[Applause]

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.199
And even if you say goodbye, you'll

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.119
never go away. You are the rainbow in my

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.280
sky. My colors in the gray. My only wish

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:37.280
upon a star. Sunshine in the day. The

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.640
only song that my piano ever plays. And

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.280
even if you say goodbye, you'll always

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.239
be around to lift me up and take me

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.600
high. Keep my feet close to the ground.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.120
Are you proud of me tonight? Dreams are

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.920
coming true. I choose the light. Nothing

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:02.320
to lose. If I lose you, new day will

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:06.720
rise. Life will go on. Everyone cries.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:11.439
Don't cry alone. Darkness will fade. All

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.030
the pain will go by. But we will stay.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:19.769
Even if you say goodbye.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.769
[Music]

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:44.000
New day will rise. Life will go

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.119
on. Everyone cries. Don't cry alone.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.640
Darkness will fade. All the pain will go

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.280
by.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.680
But we won't stay. Even if you stay new

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.000
day, life will go

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:05.399
on. Everyone cries. Don't cry alone.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.840
Darkness will fade. All the pain will go

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.840
by, but you will stay. Love of my life.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.360

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.760
new day will

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.959
rise. Everyone cries. Don't

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.040
cry. Darkness will fight. All the pain

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.040
will go by, but we will stay.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.440

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.440
Even if you say

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.430
goodbye, a new day will

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.200

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.000
day will

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.660
[Applause]

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.400
rise. Thank you, Europe.
